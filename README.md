# Reverse a String with Number Exclusion
Assignment No. 01
Java Program to Reverse a String with Number Exclusion

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to create a Java program that reverses a given string while preserving any numbers within the string. If the input string contains any numbers (only 1st occurrence),               they should remain in their original positions without being reversed.


Problem Statement:Write a Java program to reverse a string input provided by the user via the console. However, if the string contains any numerical characters, they should not be reversed; instead, they should remain in their original positions.

Requirements:The program should prompt the user to enter a string via the console. If the input string contains numerical characters, they should not be reversed. Output the reversed string, with numbers retaining their original positions.


Example:
Input: "My Name is Akasy and I am 40 years old"
Output: "old years 40 My Name is Akasy and I am."
